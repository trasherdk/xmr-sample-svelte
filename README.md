# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte library, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

Read more about creating a library [in the docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/packaging).

## 📚 Svelte 5 Reference

This project uses **Svelte 5** with the new runes system. For complete documentation and examples, see [`SVELTE_5_COMPLETE_REFERENCE.md`](./SVELTE_5_COMPLETE_REFERENCE.md) - your always-available Svelte 5 guide covering:

- 🎯 Runes system (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props`)
- 🎭 New event handling syntax
- 🧩 Snippets (replacing slots)
- 🌍 Shared state management
- 🎨 Dynamic components
- 🔍 Debugging with `$inspect`
- 📦 Migration guide from Svelte 4

Quick example:
```svelte
<script>
  let count = $state(0);
  let doubled = $derived(count * 2);
</script>

<button onclick={() => count++}>
  Count: {count}, Doubled: {doubled}
</button>
```

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

Everything inside `src/lib` is part of your library, everything inside `src/routes` can be used as a showcase or preview app.

## Building

To build your library:

```bash
npm run package
```

To create a production version of your showcase app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## Publishing

Go into the `package.json` and give your package the desired name through the `"name"` option. Also consider adding a `"license"` field and point it to a `LICENSE` file which you can create from a template (one popular option is the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)).

To publish your library to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```bash
npm publish
```
